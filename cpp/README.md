# advent-of-code-2023 / C++

⚠️ Test data is not provided in this repository. You have to download it on you own from https://adventofcode.com/ (some
examples are available only after completing a part 1 of a given puzzle).

1. Build the program in CLion.
2. In the command line run `./cmake-build-debug/advent_of_code_2023` with a puzzle day number as the first arg, whether
   it has to be part 1 or 2 of the puzzle as the second arg, and pass
   the input file to it, e.g. `./cmake-build-debug/advent_of_code_2023 1 1 < ./day01/example1_in.txt`

Alternatively, build in a command line as well,
e.g. `cmake --build cmake-build-debug && ./cmake-build-debug/advent_of_code_2023 1 1 < ./day01/example1_in.txt`
