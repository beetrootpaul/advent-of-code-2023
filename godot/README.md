# advent-of-code-2023 / Godot (GDScript)

⚠️ Test data is not provided in this repository. You have to download it on you own from https://adventofcode.com/ (some
examples are available only after completing a part 1 of a given puzzle).

⚠️You may see an error `Cannot get class 'GitPlugin` in logs. It's because [project.godot](project.godot) file has an
entry for "GitPlugin", but the plugin alone is not tracked in this repository. To install it, go to AssetLib in Godot,
then install "Godot Git Plugin (4.1+)" and reload the project.

1. Open the project in Godot `4.2.1`.
2. Open scene of the task you are interested in.
3. In the script related to the scene, uncomment proper input file name.
4. Run the game.
