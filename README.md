# advent-of-code-2023

Puzzles: https://adventofcode.com/2023

This repo contains solutions in three tech stacks:

- in [cpp direcotry](cpp/) you can find a C++ project with C++ code
- in [go direcotry](go/) you can find a Go project with Go code
- in [godot direcotry](godot/) you can find a Godot project with GDScript code
- in [monogame directory](monogame/) you can find a MonoGame/Rider project with C# code
- in [unity directory](unity/) you can find a Unity/Rider project with C# code

See `README.md` in each of projects for more info. But there is not too much of it, since in reality I am the only person making use of this repo and there is no need for a nice public documentation ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
